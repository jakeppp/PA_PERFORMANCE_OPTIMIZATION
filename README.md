# PA_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION
Using an improved BO algorithm and introducing a local search strategy to balance exploration and exploitation, the algorithm convergence speed has increased by more than 3 times. N base station product modules have been deployed, reducing power consumption by 7W, improving linear performance by 1dB, and saving 8% in labor costs.
